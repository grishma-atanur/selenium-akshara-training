How do u handle multiple elements in POM (findElements)
using @FindBy only but Data type should be List<WebElement>

How do handle alert popup using Page object model


1. in POM we use @FindBy to declare the element
2. in POM we use PageFactory.initElements(WebDriver,POMclassObj); to initialize the element
3. in POM we use @FindBy to handle multiple elements also
4. if findElemnt method is not present (ex: alert) then we cant use @FindBy
5. POM class is used to store elements and methods
6. it is also called as repository  class
7. we do not write main method in POM class
8. number of POM class will be same as number of web pages present in application
9. the class in which we write main method and call pom class method--> Test Class
10. number of Test class will be same as number of Test cases
 
TestNG
1. single click -execute multiple scripts
2. generate report

Purpose of POM class:
1)Storing the element
2)Storing the method
3)it is never meant for execution
4)We will never write main method in POM class
5)Main method should be written separately

TestNG:We need a tool for if we click run button once it should run all the test
//cases and also provide us with summary and detailed result
