xpath
path of the element in html tree

we start with . dot--> root element
we / --> child element
ex: ./html/body/a

specifying dot is not mandatory
/html/body/a

xpath supports index but in xpath index starts from 1

if we do not specify any index , it means all
ex:
/html/body/a --> all the html/all the body/all a
/html[1]/body[1]/a-->1st HTML/1st body/all a
/html[1]/body[1]/a[1]-->1st HTML/1st body/1st a

we started from root element and navigated till the element--> absolute xpath
easy to understand -> but very difficult to write--> relative xpath

./html--> child of root is html--> correct
.//a----> descendant of root is a--> correct

absolute xpath			relative xpath
/html/body/a			//a
/html/body/div/input		//input


cssSelector--> tag[AN='AV']

in xpath also we can use attribute tag[@AN='AV']



/html/body/a[@id='a1']		//a[@id='a1']

xpath will support text

tag[text()='TV']

/html/body/a[text()='Google']			//a[text()='Google']
