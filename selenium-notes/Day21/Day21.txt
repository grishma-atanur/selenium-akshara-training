list box/drop down list box/combo box
created using <select> tag
items are added using <option> tag

in selenium we can handle list box using Select class
it has parameterized constructor which takes an arg type WebElement
in Select class we have 3 methods to select
1. select by index (int)
2. select by value (str)
3. select by visible text(str)

value and text is CS

if any of the arg is invalid we get NSEE

4. getOptions()---> returns all the options present in listbox
5. getWrappedElement()

Handling multi select listbox 

Code is same for Single Select and Multi select listbox

but only deselect method works on MSLB, if we try to use it on SSLB we get exception

6. deselect by index (int)
7. deselect by value (str)
8. deselect by visible text(str)
9. deselect All ()
10. isMultiple () --> true means MSLB , false means SSLB

Homework
print content of list box in reverse sorted order
