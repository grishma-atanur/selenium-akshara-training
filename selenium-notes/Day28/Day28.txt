Note:1)When it comes to execution of xml file , it is always top to bottom
2)Whenever TestNG come accross starting tag in xml file, it will execute respective
before method
3)Whenever TestNG come accross ending tag in xml file, it will execute respective
after method
4)Writing method in xml file is not mandatory,whether you write method tag or not 
in xml file, it will execute.

Program:day28-Demo3:
//if we dont use priority,by default this code will execute in alphabetical order
//if we use priority , we can control sequence of execution
//pririty need not be consecutive

Full Regression Testing: Imagine if we have 600 manual test cases ,
we converted all of them and we got 600 tests.If We execute all the
testcases then it is called Full Regression Testing.

Regional Regression testing: Imagine in my product there are 4 modules(M1,M2,M3,M4)
if we have 200 testcases in each module-->Total 800 test cases are there, but customer
asked us to modify in M2 and we are 100% sure that this modification in no way
affects M1, M3, M4,it is affecting only one  module M2 customer is in very hurry then 
we will only test M2.But TestNG runs all the tests, that is where we need a concept called  TestNG Group.

Interview Question: In TestNG , how to run only selected test cases?
Answer) Using TestNG Groups-In this there are two choices:Include and Exclude(Xml file)

Genraly for Test method we add priority and Group and for other method we add "always run" and "Enabled=false"

TestNG Group concept is very important for Interview.

TestNG groups
1. include
2. exclude
3. priority
4. alwaysRun=true
5. enabled=false

Assert.fail();-->You are telling TestNG, in TestNG report you change status from Pass To Fail.
When u use Assert,fail(), it will fail by throwing Assertion error.When u use Assert.fail(), the statements
following Assert.fail(); in the same method will not execute,but every else following will get executed.

Interview Question:How to u perform verification in TestNG
Answer)using Assert.assertEquals(actual, expected)

1. Assert is a class
2. all its methods are static and overloaded
3. assertEquals,   assertNotEquals, assertTrue,    assertFalse  fail(), ....lot more assert methods we have.

Interview Question:Differnece between Assert and SoftAssert.
Assert								SoftAssert
exit current Test if failed		it will not exit current Test if failed
all the methods are static		non-static method
we dont call assertAll			we must call assertAll at the end

Note:1)No difference between Assert and soft Assert if Test is passing,if test is failing then 
only we can see difference.
2)whenever you use SoftAssert, you must use assertAll(); otherwise SoftAssert doesnt work.
3)Wherever there is basic and critical feature, we should use Assert, for other functionalities where
it is not blocking we should use softAssert.
4)There is no hard and fast rule when to use Assert and SoftAssert, we are the one to decide-for that we
need to know the Application very well.
