NoSuchElementException
1. invalid locator type
2. invalid locator value
3. inside the frame
4. inside the child window
5. inside the new tab
6. invalid index/value/visible text (select)
7. timing issue (synchronization)

synchronization point
process of matching selenium speed with application

solution:
1.Thread.sleep(n*1000) ---> wait for n seconds- but it does not check if element is present or not, it is called as blind wait, we should specify multiple times (wherever app is slow)
this is a java code 

2. implicit wait

  1. method is implicitlyWait
  2. the duration specified in implicitlyWait is used by all findElement/findElements 
  3. if we set 10S in implicitlyWait, it is 10S for each FE/FES statement
  4. we need not specify IW multiple times
  5. default value for IW is 0s
  polling timeout PT10S
