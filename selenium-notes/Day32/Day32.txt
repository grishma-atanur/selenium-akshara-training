Disadvantage of declaring WebDriver as static:
1)If the WebDriver is Static(Single copy of variable), Parallel execution is not possible.
So we will declare WebDriver as non-static.

Creating new Workspace:
1)Create a folder in local system:b115WS
2)To save all the previous programs from previous workspace:
  a)Go to Eclipse.
  b)Rght click on Project
  c)Go to Properties
  d)under Resuorce
  e)Copy the Location and save it -where the previuos Programs are save
  	for future Reference.-->Find this in Selenium Folder.
3)To switch to other workspace-->Go to eclipse-->File-->Other
4)It will ask for Directory location.
5)Browse and select the folder that we just created-->b115WS
6)Click on Launch.
7)Now create a Maven Project-->
8)In Eclipse-->File-->New-->Maven Project-->Check box-->Create a simple project.
9)Give Group id--as akshara
10)artifact id-->b115afw
   afw is automation frame work.
11)Click on finish.
12)Add all the dependecies in POM.xml from prvious workspace to this Workspace in POM.xml
13)Save it and close it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)In Maven Project-->We should write java project in src/test/java.
2)In scr/test/java-->Create folders called generic,page, script.
3)Under generic-->Create a java class called BaseTest.
4)Under script folder-->Create test class called Demotest.java.
5)Covert Demotest.java to TestNG.xml
6)Run TestNG.xml as TestNG Suite
7)use the package tag in TestNG.xml-->it runs all the scripts present inside the 
script package.
8)In POM.xml surefile plugin is already added.
9)Right on POM.xml -->Run As -->Maven Test.
10)Sequence to Run-->First Run Demotest.java-->Then Run TestnG.xml-->Then Run POM.xml
11)If you Run POM.xml-->You will see result in target folder-surefire report-->Emailable-report.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It not good idea to hardcode everything, there are 3 ways:
1)First-->We can take input from TestNG.xml-->using parameters.
2)Second-->We can take data from excel file .
3)Third-->property file-->Very popular,in Property file we store Key-value pair,internally
	it is a MAP actually.
4)To create property file-->In eclipse-->Right click on project-->New-->File-->
give name-->config.properties
5)Property file is simple text file where values are stored based on the key.
6)Copy paste property file directly under project.
7)How to read property file-->Create Demo3 under script package-->write necessary code to read property file
Note: Hashtable is parent of Property

Properties  =new Propeerties();
p.load(new FileInputStream(./config.properties)//In current java project loadconfig.properties

Note: If we make changes in config.properties-->We dont need to recompile java program all the time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to create a method so that i can use it again and again:
1)Under generic-->Create a class called Utility
2)If a method is accessing any non-static variable of a class-->Then only it
should be declared as non-static.


general guideline to  develop a method:
1. do not hardcode any input--> use method argument
2. do not throw any exception - use try-catch
3. in catch  block printStackTrace
4. by default it should be static
5. if its getter method , return a value--If u use try ,catch return in both try and catch block
  or write common return statement to both try and catch.









home work
1. add firefox , safari ... browser code
2. print details each step in BaseTest
