when do we scroll?
if the element is not displayed at current visible area of the page
(scroll and click)

scroll and take the screenshot

Note: we can try using 3rd party tool to take screenshot of complete page
ex: AShot

in selenium 4 we can use new methods available under Actions class to scroll
Note: Actions class is present in selenium 3 also


Action--> interface 
Actions --> class
both are present under interactions package

Actions class has parameterized constructor
Whenever we call any method of Actions class we must call perform method at the end

how do you handle drop down menu?/how do u perform mouse hover action?
--> using moveToElement method of Actions class

Home work: goto testers hub->Demo Testing site--> tooltip

how do u right click on the element using selenium?
how do u handle context menu?

Home work: double click and print before and after color
